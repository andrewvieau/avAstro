# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-07-22

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

## Additional notes that are not copy/pasted

## Unit 1: Commit your local code to Github

I hit my first roadblock on the final step of [Commit your local code to GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/4/). When I tried to commit, I got an error: "Repository already exists."
    
Thank you to [Late Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@latedeveloper7836) for recording [the solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WWf-iem3oA) a year ago.
