After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## Unit 2: Use your first CSS variable

I have Github Copilot installed on VS Code, and I found it interesting that it offered to auto-complete the "Try it yourself" exercise.  I've been ignoring most of the auto-completion prompts so far, which have generally been giving generic suggestions with clearly AI generated text.  This time it suggested the exact font weight & text case. This was something I was supposed to enter myself, building on knowledge from a previous exercise to prove that I understood the syntax.

I'm curious if there were hints in the way I was building earlier, if GC is familiar with the tutorial, or if it's just pulling from the likely thousands of other public repos with the exact same info.  

Taken to extremes, I could imagine future software developers going through tutorials and having AI predicting all the code they're about to write. So far I'm just going to ignore the AI predictive stuff, but if it gets annoying or seems to be impacting learning, I might need to turn it off.
