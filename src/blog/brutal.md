## New style

This week while attending Scott Moss' [Build an AI Agent from Scratch v2](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/ai-agents-v2/) workshop at Frontend Masters, I discovered Brutalism.

Specifically, on the [Cloudflare Sandbox](https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/) & [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) web pages.  I had seen this style before but never had a name for it.

Once I had a name for it, I fired up Github Copilot and did a zero-shot prompt redesign of my site:

> Apply a Brutalist design to all pages modifying CSS only

It's not going to win any design prizes, but I like it a little better than it was before. Hard to say how long I'll keep it like this, but I'm sticking with it for now.
