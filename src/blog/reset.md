## Old style

[Vibe Coding Brutalism](brutal) was fun, but I got a little too deep into the AI styling and ended up with something I had no idea how to modify.

For now I'm resetting to an older commit, and starting over with a different Astro tutorial.  I'm one hour into [Astro for Fast Website Development](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/astro) by Jason Lengstorf on Frontend Masters, and I'm loving it.
