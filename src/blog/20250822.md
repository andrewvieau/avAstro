## Some updates

I made a very simple component that highlights a featured blog post.  Specifically, the most recent blog post tagged as "featured."

I also added Tailwind CSS and changed my color scheme.

I might write a few tutorials based on this work, as an extension of the default.

One of these days I may update all of these blog posts with a real image, but not yet.

I've got another blog post I'm planning on making on LinkedIn about my chaco sandals.
