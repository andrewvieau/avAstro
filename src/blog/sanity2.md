## The short version

[Contentful Astro Starter](https://www.contentful.com/astro-starter/) worked like a charm. Some difficulty figuring out how to get the right API Key vs the Content token, but all very google-able roadblocks.

For reasons I won't get into, I decided to start another Single-Page Application focused on promoting myself as an independent contractor.  I used Github Copilot, which recommended using React. I went in with a mindset of vibe-coding the whole thing, and in the process ended upgrading my nodejs version.

That gave me the idea to revisit my roadblock from yesterday, and this time **npm audit fix â€“force** solved the problem.  While I probably don't need all the dev flexibility that Sanity brings to the table, I might want it in the future.
